### Pokemon project

- This project is made with `React Context API` . We also implement an alternative via `userReducer hooks`
- Context codes are in `context` folder. If we use **context** in our project _src/app.js_ will be same as _context/\_app.js_
- Reducer codes are in `reducer` folder.
- To install dependency `yarn install`. To run project `yarn start`
